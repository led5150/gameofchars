# gameofchars

**Welcome to the Game of Chars!**

***********
This program simulates a Universe in which the primary Organisms are 2D arrays of alphanumeric ASCII characters. Organisms are born, live, eat,
grow, mutate, replicate, fight, make babies, decay slowly, and eventually die like the rest of us!  Watch in wonderment as the miracle of life unfolds
before your very eyes.  Witness the spontaneous creation of creatures as quantum fluctuations occur.  Why, even marvel at the movement of these plucky
little Organisms as they move about from the right side of the screen, over to the left, from top to bottom, bottom to top and everywhere in between!  
It's as if their entire world is a sphere, flattened out into a (default or user defined) rectangular space.  Or any space of your choosing (as long as it is > 0 x 0)!  Can't wait to get started?  Read on!

## To get started: 

The compiled binary is included, so you may simply use that if you don't want to make any changes to the source code. It should work well in most
Linux/Unix environments.

Or you can use the provided Makefile to re-compile the code after making any modifications.

Here is the requisite usage dialog:

  Usage: ./gameofchars [HEIGHT] [WIDTH] [filename]
         ./gameofchars filename
